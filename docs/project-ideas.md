## Command Center Using Government APIs

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: Idea / Concept stage

### Concept
A command center application that aggregates and interfaces with various government APIs to provide centralized access to public data and services.

### Potential Government API Sources
- **Federal**:
  - Data.gov (data catalog)
  - Census Bureau API (demographics, economic data)
  - NOAA (weather, climate data)
  - NASA APIs (space, earth science)
  - USGS (geological, water data)
  - Bureau of Labor Statistics (employment, economic indicators)
  - SEC EDGAR (financial disclosures)
  - USASpending.gov (federal spending)

- **State/Local**:
  - State open data portals
  - Municipal 311 systems
  - Public records databases

### Possible Use Cases
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Data aggregation and analysis
- Automated reporting
- Alert systems for specific events
- Research and exploration interface
- Public information access tool

### Technical Considerations
- API authentication and rate limiting
- Data normalization across different sources
- Caching strategies
- Real-time vs. batch processing
- Geographic filtering (by state, county, zip)

### Questions to Explore
- Which APIs provide the most value?
- What specific problem does this solve?
- Who is the target user?
- Local-first or cloud-based?
- Integration with MESO organelle?
