# Techbiont Framework

Universal standing orders and methodologies for human-AI collaborative development.

## What Is This?

A **techbiont** is a symbiotic fusion of human intelligence and AI capability functioning as a unified cognitive system. This repository contains the operational framework for effective human-AI pair programming and development collaboration.

## Contents

- **STANDING-ORDERS.md** - Comprehensive guide covering:
  - The Techbiont Framework (philosophy and operating principles)
  - Standing Orders (9 core rules for AI-assisted development)
  - Context Engineering (managing AI context effectively)
  - Auditing Protocol (verification and quality assurance)
  - Prompt Engineering (effective communication patterns)
  - Methods & Practices (workflows and session management)
  - After Action Reports (lessons learned archive)
  - Templates (reusable formats)

## Key Concepts

- **Autonomy Levels (L1-L4)**: Framework for calibrating AI independence to task risk
- **Verification Loop**: Write → Test → Feed errors back → Fix → Repeat (improves quality 2-3x)
- **Context Engineering**: "The delicate art of filling the context window with just the right information"
- **Exosymbiotic Organelle**: The AI as a tool integrated into—but serving—the human operator

## Research Basis

This framework incorporates empirically-validated findings from:
- Addy Osmani's LLM Coding Workflow research
- Simon Willison's practical LLM usage guides
- Anthropic's Claude Code best practices
- Academic research on human-AI collaboration and code verification
- Knight First Amendment Institute's autonomy levels framework

## Usage
